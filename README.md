# A Link to the Past Randomizer Mystery Points Calculator

## General Info:

This is a tracker for use during A Link to the Past Randomizer mystery seeds. In ALttPR mystery seeds, the settings are initially unknown and must be discovered through playing the game. 

This Calculator has buttons that correspond to the various possible settings options, so that as information about the seed is revealed, a runner can track those settings for reference purposes.

The World State options at the top of the tracker determine certain settings options; some settings options are only applicable to entrance seeds, and others are only applicable to non-entrance seeds, though most settings options apply to all seeds.

When a World State option is selected, inapplicable settings options will be hidden from the tracker.

## Points Info:

In addition, beginning with Season 17 of A Link to the Past Randomizer ladder, each settings option is associated with a particular amount of Mystery Points.

Generally, the more difficult or esoteric the setting is, the more points it is worth.

The number of points each setting is worth, if any, is listed on the Calculator in parentheses. Settings are organized such that options worth more points are on the right.

The total number of points among all the options is fixed depending on the World State; there are exactly 150 Mystery Points to be allocated for seeds without entrance shuffle, 80 for seeds with entrance shuffle, and 50 for seeds involving OHKO.

This Calculator features an ongoing display of the amount of Mystery Points yet to be allocated -- that is, the difference between the total number of points (150 for non-entrance, etc.) and the sum of the points from all the other settings options that have been selected.

The ongoing point total display can be useful as a deduction tool to help make more informed routing decisions during ALttPR gameplay.

## Miscellaneous Quirks:

If the World State option is changed mid-run, settings options that are inapplicable for the current World State will not affect the point total even if they were previously selected.

The Starting Boots option from season 17 works backwards from all the other starting item options; starting *without* the boots in non-entrance shuffle seeds is worth 20 points, and starting *with* the boots is worth 0 points.

Starting without the boots has no effect on seeds with entrance shuffle (that setting is not applicable since it is currently impossible for entrance shuffle seeds to have any starting item other than assured sword).
